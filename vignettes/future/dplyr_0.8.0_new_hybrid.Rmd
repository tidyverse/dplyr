# overview

This is a complete redesign of how we evaluate expression in dplyr. We no longer attempt to evaluate part of an expression. We now either: 

- recognize the entire expression, e.g. `n()` or `mean(x)` and use C++ code to evaluate it (this is what we call hybrid evaluation now, but I guess another term would be better. 
- if not, we use standard evaluation in a suitable environment

# data mask

When used internally in the c++ code, a tibble become one of the 3 classes `GroupedDataFrame`, `RowwiseDataFrame` or `NaturalDataFrame`. Most internal code is templated by these classes, e.g. `summarise` is: 

```cpp
// [[Rcpp::export]]
SEXP summarise_impl(DataFrame df, QuosureList dots) {
  check_valid_colnames(df);
  if (is<RowwiseDataFrame>(df)) {
    return summarise_grouped<RowwiseDataFrame>(df, dots);
  } else if (is<GroupedDataFrame>(df)) {
    return summarise_grouped<GroupedDataFrame>(df, dots);
  } else {
    return summarise_grouped<NaturalDataFrame>(df, dots);
  }
}
```

The `DataMask<SlicedTibble>` template class is used by both hybrid and standard evaluation to extract the relevant information from the 
columns (original columns or columns that have just been made by `mutate()` or `summarise()`)

# standard evaluation

## meta information about the groups

The functions `n()`, `row_number()` and `group_indices()` when called without arguments 
lack contextual information, i.e. the current group size and index, 
so they look for that information a the special environment 

```r
n <- function() {
  from_context("..group_size")
}
```

The DataMask class is responsible for updating the variables `..group_size` and `..group_number`

```cpp
    // update the data context variables, these are used by n(), ...
    get_context_env()["..group_size"] = indices.size();
    get_context_env()["..group_number"] = indices.group() + 1;
```

all other functions can just be called with standard evaluation in the data mask

## active and resolved bindings

When doing standard evaluation, we need to install a data mask that evaluates the symbols from the data
to the relevant subset. The simple solution would be to update the data mask at each iteration with
subsets for all the variables but that would be potentially expensive and a waste, as we might not need
all of the variables at a given time, e.g. in this case: 

```r
iris %>% group_by(Species) %>% summarise(Sepal.Length = +mean(Sepal.Length))
```

We only need to materialize `Sepal.Length`, we don't need the other variables. 

`DataMask` installs an active binding for each variable in one of (the top) 
the environment in the data mask ancestry, the active binding function is generated by this function 
so that it holds an index and a pointer to the data mask in its enclosure. 

```{r}
dplyr:::.make_active_binding_fun
```

When hit, the active binding calls the exported `materialize_binding()` C++ function,
which forwards to `DataMask<>::materialize(idx)`.
The `DataMask<>::materialize(idx)` method returns the materialized subset, but also: 
- install the result in the bottom environment of the data mask, so that it mask the 
  active binding. The point is to call the active binding only once. 
- remembers that the binding at position `idx` has been materialized, so that before
  evaluating the same expression in the next group, it is proactively
  materialized, because it is very likely that we need the same variables for all groups

When we move to the next expression to evaluate, `DataMask` forgets about the materialized
bindings so that the active binding can be triggered again as needed. 

use case of the DataMask class 

- before evaluating expressions, construct a DataMask from a tibble

```cpp
DataMask<SlicedTibble> mask(tbl);
```

- before evaluating a new expression, we need to `rechain(parent_env)` to prepare the data mask to 
  evaluate expression with a given parent environment. This "forgets" about the materialized 
  bindings. 
  
```cpp
mask.rechain(quosure.env());
```

- before evaluating the expression ona new group, the indices are updated, this includes 
  rematerializing the already materialized bindings
  

# hybrid evaluation

## Use of DataMask

Hybrid evaluation also uses the `DataMask<>` class, but it only needs to quickly retrieve
the data for an entire column. This is what the `maybe_get_subset_binding` method does. 

```cpp
  // returns a pointer to the ColumnBinding if it exists
  // this is mostly used by the hybrid evaluation
  const ColumnBinding<SlicedTibble>* maybe_get_subset_binding(const SymbolString& symbol) const {
    int pos = symbol_map.find(symbol);
    if (pos >= 0) {
      return &column_bindings[pos];
    } else {
      return 0;
    }
  }
```

when the symbol map contains the binding, we get a `ColumnBinding<SlicedTibble>*`. These objects hold these fields:

```cpp
  // is this a summary binding, i.e. does it come from summarise
  bool summary;

  // symbol of the binding
  SEXP symbol;

  // data. it is own either by the original data frame or by the
  // accumulator, so no need for additional protection here
  SEXP data;
```

hybrid evaluation only needs `summary` and `data`. 

## Expression

When attempting to evaluate an expression with the hybrid evaluator, we first construct an `Expression` object. 
This class has methods to quickly check if the expression can be managed, e.g. 

```cpp 
    // sum( <column> ) and base::sum( <column> )
    if (expression.is_fun(s_sum, s_base, ns_base)) {
      Column x;
      if (expression.is_unnamed(0) && expression.is_column(0, x)) {
        return sum_(data, x, /* na.rm = */ false, op);
      } else {
        return R_UnboundValue;
      }
    }
```

This checks that the call matches `sum(<column>)` or `base::sum(<column>)` where `<column>` is a column from the data mask. 

In that example, the `Expression` class checks that: 
- the first argument is not named 
- the first argument is a column from the data

Otherwise it means it is an expression that we can't handle, so we return `R_UnboundValue` which is the hybrid evaluation 
way to signal it gives up on handling the expression, and that it should be evaluated with standard evaluation. 

Expression has the following methods: 

- `inline bool is_fun(SEXP symbol, SEXP pkg, SEXP ns)` : are we calling `fun` ? If so does `fun` curently resolve to the 
  function we intend to (it might not if the function is masked, which allows to do trghings like this:)

```r
> n <- function() 42
> summarise(iris, nn = n())
  nn
1 42
```

- `bool is_valid() const` : is the expression valid. the Expressio, constructor rules out a few expressions that hjave no chance of being
  handled, such as pkg::fun() when `pkg` is none of `dplyr`, `stats` or `base`

- `SEXP value(int i) const` : the expression at position i

- `bool is_named(int i, SEXP symbol) const` : is the i'th argument named `symbol`

- `bool is_scalar_logical(int i, bool& test) const` : is the i'th argument a scalar logical, we need this for handling e.g. `na.rm = TRUE`

- `bool is_scalar_int(int i, int& out) const` is the i'th argument a scalar int, we need this for `n = <int>`

- `bool is_column(int i, Column& column) const` is the i'th argument a column. 

## hybrid_do

The `hybrid_do` function uses methods from `Expression` to quickly assess if it can handle the expression and then calls the relevant 
function from `dplyr::hybrid::` to create the result at once: 

```cpp 
    if (expression.is_fun(s_sum, s_base, ns_base)) {
      // sum( <column> ) and base::sum( <column> )
      Column x;
      if (expression.is_unnamed(0) && expression.is_column(0, x)) {
        return sum_(data, x, /* na.rm = */ false, op);
      }
    } else if (expression.is_fun(s_mean, s_base, ns_base)) {
      // mean( <column> ) and base::mean( <column> )

      Column x;
      if (expression.is_unnamed(0) && expression.is_column(0, x)) {
        return mean_(data, x, false, op);
      }
    } else if ...
```

The functions in the C++ `dplyr::hybrid::` namespace create objects whose classes hold: 
- the type of output they create
- the information they need (e.g. the column, the value of na.rm, ...)

These classes all have these methods: 
- `summarise()` to return a result of the same size as the number of groups. This is used when op is a `Summary`. This returns `R_UnboundValue` to give up 
  when the class can't do that, e.g. the classes behind `lag`
- `window()` to return a result of the same size as the number of rows in the original data set. 

The classes typically don't provide these methods directly, but rather inherit, via CRTP one of: 
- `HybridVectorScalarResult`, so that the class only has to provide a `process` method, for example the `Count` class: 

```cpp
template <typename SlicedTibble>
class Count : public HybridVectorScalarResult<INTSXP, SlicedTibble, Count<SlicedTibble> > {
public:
  typedef HybridVectorScalarResult<INTSXP, SlicedTibble, Count<SlicedTibble> > Parent ;

  Count(const SlicedTibble& data) : Parent(data) {}

  int process(const typename SlicedTibble::slicing_index& indices) const {
    return indices.size();
  }
} ;
```

`HybridVectorScalarResult` uses the result of `process` in both `summarise()` and `window()`


- `HybridVectorVectorResult` expects a `fill` method, e.g. implementation of `ntile(n=<int>)` uses this class
  that derive from HybridVectorVectorResult. 
  
```cpp
template <typename SlicedTibble>
class Ntile1 : public HybridVectorVectorResult<INTSXP, SlicedTibble, Ntile1<SlicedTibble> > {
public:
  typedef HybridVectorVectorResult<INTSXP, SlicedTibble, Ntile1> Parent;

  Ntile1(const SlicedTibble& data, int ntiles_): Parent(data), ntiles(ntiles_) {}

  void fill(const typename SlicedTibble::slicing_index& indices, Rcpp::IntegerVector& out) const {
    int m = indices.size();
    for (int j = m - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
      out[ indices[j] ] = (int)floor((ntiles * j) / m) + 1;
    }
  }

private:
  int ntiles;
};
```

The result of `fill` is only used in `window()`. The `summarise()` method simpliy returns `R_UnboundValue` 
to give up.
