\title{Apply a function or a set of functions to a set of columns}
\usage{
across(select, funs = identity)
}
\arguments{
\item{select}{tidy selection of columns, forwarded to \code{\link[=pick]{pick()}}}

\item{funs}{Functions to apply to each of the selected columns. Possible
values are:
\itemize{
\item A single function or a single quosure style lambda, e.g. \code{~ mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE)}
\item A named list of functions and/or lambdas
}

@return A tibble

@details

When a single function is given, it is applied to each of the selected columns
and the output columns are named after the selected input columns.

When a named list of functions is given, the result is made of as many columns
as the number of functions, each of these output columns is a pack, i.e.
a data frame column made from the result of the function applied across the
selected columns.}

\description{
Creates a data frame by applying a set of functions to a tidy
selection of columns in the current slice

\examples{

# A single function
iris \%>\%
  group_by(Species) \%>\%
  summarise(across(starts_with("Sepal"), mean))

iris \%>\%
  group_by(Species) \%>\%
  summarise(across(starts_with("Sepal"), ~mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE)))

# a named list of functions
iris \%>\%
  group_by(Species) \%>\%
  summarise(across(starts_with("Sepal"), list(mean = mean, sd = sd)))
