\title{Group input by rows}
\usage{
rowwise(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Input data frame.}
}
\description{
\code{rowwise} is used for the results of \code{\link{do}} when you
create list-variables. It is also useful to support arbitrary
complex operations that need to be applied to each row.
}
\details{
Currently \code{rowwise} grouping only works with data frames. Its
main impact is to allow you to work with list-variables in
\code{\link{summarise}} and \code{\link{mutate}} without having to
use \code{[[1]]}. This makes \code{summarise()} on a rowwise tbl
effectively equivalent to plyr's \code{ldply}.
}
\examples{
df <- expand.grid(x = 1:3, y = 3:1)
df \%>\% rowwise() \%>\% do(i = seq(.$x, .$y))
.Last.value \%>\% summarise(n = length(i))
}
