\title{Choose rows by position}
\usage{
slice(.data, ..., .preserve = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A tbl.}

\item{...}{<\code{\link[=dplyr_tidy_eval]{tidy-eval}}> Integer row values.
Provide either positive values to keep, or negative values to drop.
The values provided must be either all positive or all negative.
Indices beyond the number of rows in the input are silently ignored.}

\item{.preserve}{when \code{FALSE} (the default), the grouping structure
is recalculated based on the resulting data, otherwise it is kept as is.}
}
\value{
An object of the same type as \code{.data}.
\itemize{
\item Each row may appear 0, 1, or many times in the output.
\item Columns are not modified.
\item Groups are not modified.
\item Data frame attributes are preserved.
}
}
\description{
Choose rows by their ordinal position in the tbl.  Grouped tbls use
the ordinal position within the group.
}
\details{
Slice does not work with relational databases because they have no
intrinsic notion of row order. If you want to perform the equivalent
operation, use \code{\link[=filter]{filter()}} and \code{\link[=row_number]{row_number()}}.
}
\examples{
slice(mtcars, 1L)
# Similar to tail(mtcars, 1):
slice(mtcars, n())
slice(mtcars, 5:n())
# Rows can be dropped with negative indices:
slice(mtcars, -5:-n())
# In this case, the result will be equivalent to:
slice(mtcars, 1:4)

by_cyl <- group_by(mtcars, cyl)
slice(by_cyl, 1:2)

# Equivalent code using filter that will also work with databases,
# but won't be as fast for in-memory data. For many databases, you'll
# need to supply an explicit variable to use to compute the row number.
filter(mtcars, row_number() == 1L)
filter(mtcars, row_number() == n())
filter(mtcars, between(row_number(), 5, n()))
