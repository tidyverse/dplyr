\title{A bigquery data source.}
\usage{
src_bigquery(project, dataset, billing = project)

\method{tbl}{src_bigquery}(src, from, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{project}{project id or name}

\item{dataset}{dataset name}

\item{billing}{billing project, if different to \code{project}}

\item{src}{a bigquery src created with \code{src_bigquery}.}

\item{from}{Either a string giving the name of table in database, or
\code{\link{sql}} described a derived table or compound join.}

\item{...}{Included for compatibility with the generic, but otherwise
ignored.}
}
\description{
Use \code{src_bigquery} to connect to an existing bigquery dataset,
and \code{tbl} to connect to tables within that database.
}
\section{Debugging}{


To see exactly what SQL is being sent to the database, you can set option
\code{dplyr.show_sql} to true: \code{options(dplyr.show_sql = TRUE).}
If you're wondering why a particularly query is slow, it can be helpful
to see the query plan. You can do this by setting
\code{options(dplyr.explain_sql = TRUE)}.
}

\section{Grouping}{


Typically you will create a grouped data table is to call the \code{group_by}
method on a mysql tbl: this will take care of capturing
the unevalated expressions for you.

For best performance, the database should have an index on the variables
that you are grouping by. Use \code{\link{explain_sql}} to check that
mysql is using the indexes that you expect.
}

\section{Output}{


All data manipulation on SQL tbls are lazy: they will not actually
run the query or retrieve the data unless you ask for it: they all return
a new \code{\link{tbl_sql}} object. Use \code{\link{compute}} to run the
query and save the results in a temporary in the database, or use
\code{\link{collect}} to retrieve the results to R.

Note that \code{do} is not lazy since it must pull the data into R.
It returns a \code{\link{tbl_df}} or \code{\link{grouped_df}}, with one
column for each grouping variable, and one list column that contains the
results of the operation. \code{do} never simplifies its output.
}

\section{Query principles}{


This section attempts to lay out the principles governing the generation
of SQL queries from the manipulation verbs.  The basic principle is that
a sequence of operations should return the same value (modulo class)
regardless of where the data is stored.

\itemize{
 \item \code{arrange(arrange(df, x), y)} should be equivalent to
   \code{arrange(df, y, x)}

 \item \code{select(select(df, a:x), n:o)} should be equivalent to
   \code{select(df, n:o)}

 \item \code{mutate(mutate(df, x2 = x * 2), y2 = y * 2)} should be
    equivalent to \code{mutate(df, x2 = x * 2, y2 = y * 2)}

 \item \code{filter(filter(df, x == 1), y == 2)} should be
    equivalent to \code{filter(df, x == 1, y == 2)}

 \item \code{summarise} should return the summarised output with
   one level of grouping peeled off.

\examples{
# Connection basics ---------------------------------------------------------
\dontrun{
# To connect to a database first create a src:
my_db <- src_bigquery("myproject", "mydataset")
# Then reference a tbl within that src
my_tbl <- tbl(my_db, "my_table")
}

# Here we'll use the Lahman database: to create your own local copy,
# create a local database called "lahman", or tell lahman_bigqueryql() how to
# a database that you can write to

if (has_lahman("bigquery") && interactive()) {
# Methods -------------------------------------------------------------------
batting <- tbl(lahman_bigquery(), "Batting")
dim(batting)
colnames(batting)
head(batting)

# Data manipulation verbs ---------------------------------------------------
filter(batting, yearID > 2005, G > 130)
select(batting, playerID:lgID)
arrange(batting, playerID, desc(yearID))
summarise(batting, G = mean(G), n = n())
mutate(batting, rbi2 = if(is.null(AB)) 1.0 * R / AB else 0)

# note that all operations are lazy: they don't do anything until you
# request the data, either by `print()`ing it (which shows the first ten
# rows), by looking at the `head()`, or `collect()` the results locally.

system.time(recent <- filter(batting, yearID > 2010))
system.time(collect(recent))

# Group by operations -------------------------------------------------------
# To perform operations by group, create a grouped object with group_by
players <- group_by(batting, playerID)
group_size(players)

summarise(players, mean_g = mean(G), best_ab = max(AB))
filter(players, AB == max(AB) | G == max(G))
mutate(players, cumulative = order_by(yearID, cumsum(AB)))
mutate(players, rank())

# When you group by multiple level, each summarise peels off one level
per_year <- group_by(batting, playerID, yearID)
stints <- summarise(per_year, stints = max(stint))
filter(stints, stints > 3)
summarise(stints, max(stints))
# Not supported yet:
\dontrun{mutate(stints, cumsum(stints, yearID))}
# But other window functions are:
mutate(players, rank = rank(ab))

# Joins ---------------------------------------------------------------------
player_info <- select(tbl(lahman_bigquery(), "Master"), playerID, hofID,
  birthYear)
hof <- select(filter(tbl(lahman_bigquery(), "HallOfFame"), inducted == "Y"),
 hofID, votedBy, category)

# Match players and their hall of fame data
inner_join(player_info, hof)
# Keep all players, match hof data where available
left_join(player_info, hof)
# Find only players in hof
semi_join(player_info, hof)
# Find players not in hof
anti_join(player_info, hof)

# Arbitrary SQL -------------------------------------------------------------
# You can also provide sql as is, using the sql function:
batting2008 <- tbl(lahman_bigqueryql(),
  sql("SELECT * FROM Batting WHERE YearID = 2008"))
batting2008
