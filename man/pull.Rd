\title{Extract a single column}
\usage{
pull(.data, var = -1, name = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A table of data}

\item{var}{A variable specified as:
\itemize{
\item a literal variable name
\item a positive integer, giving the position counting from the left
\item a negative integer, giving the position counting from the right.
}

The default returns the last column (on the assumption that's the
column you've created most recently).

This argument is taken by expression and supports
\link[rlang:quasiquotation]{quasiquotation} (you can unquote column
names and column locations).}

\item{name}{An optional parameter that specifies the column to be used
as names for a named vector. Specified in a similar manner as \code{var}.}
}
\value{
A vector the same size as \code{.data}.
}
\description{
\code{pull()} is similar to \code{$}. It's mostly useful because it looks a little
nicer in pipes, it also works with remote data frames, and it can optionally
name the output.

\examples{
mtcars \%>\% pull(-1)
mtcars \%>\% pull(1)
mtcars \%>\% pull(cyl)

# Also works for remote sources
if (requireNamespace("dbplyr", quietly = TRUE)) {
df <- dbplyr::memdb_frame(x = 1:10, y = 10:1, .name = "pull-ex")
df \%>\%
  mutate(z = x * y) \%>\%
  pull()
}

# Pull a named vector
starwars \%>\% pull(height, name)
}
