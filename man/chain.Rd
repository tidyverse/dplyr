\title{Chain together multiple operations.}
\usage{
chain(..., env = parent.frame())

chain_q(calls, env = parent.frame())

lhs \%.\% rhs

lhs \%>\% rhs
}
\arguments{
\item{...,calls}{A sequence of data transformations, starting with a dataset.
The first argument of each call should be omitted - the value of the
previous step will be substituted in automatically. Use \code{chain} and
\code{...} when working interactive; use \code{chain_q} and \code{calls}
when calling from another function.}

\item{env}{Environment in which to evaluation expressions. In ordinary
operation you should not need to set this parameter.}

\item{lhs,rhs}{A dataset and function to apply to it}
}
\description{
The downside of the functional nature of dplyr is that when you combine
multiple data manipulation operations, you have to read from the inside
out and the arguments may be very distant to the function call. These
functions providing an alternative way of calling dplyr (and other data
manipulation) functions that you read can from left to right.
}
\details{
The functions work via simple substitution so that
\code{x \%>\% f(y)} is translated into \code{f(x, y)}.

\section{Deprecation}{


\code{chain} was deprecated in version 0.2, and will be removed in
0.3. \code{\%.\%} was deprecated in version 0.3, and defunct in 0.4.
They wwere removed in the interest of making dplyr code more
standardised and \code{\%>\%} is much more popular.

\examples{
# If you're performing many operations you can either do step by step
if (require("nycflights13")) {
a1 <- group_by(flights, year, month, day)
a2 <- select(a1, arr_delay, dep_delay)
a3 <- summarise(a2,
  arr = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
  dep = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
a4 <- filter(a3, arr > 30 | dep > 30)

# If you don't want to save the intermediate results, you need to
# wrap the functions:
filter(
  summarise(
    select(
      group_by(flights, year, month, day),
      arr_delay, dep_delay
    ),
    arr = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    dep = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  ),
  arr > 30 | dep > 30
)

# This is difficult to read because the order of the operations is from
# inside to out, and the arguments are a long way away from the function.
# Alternatively you can use \%>\% to sequence the operations
# linearly:

flights \%>\%
  group_by(year, month, day) \%>\%
  select(arr_delay, dep_delay) \%>\%
  summarise(
    arr = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
    dep = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) \%>\%
  filter(arr > 30 | dep > 30)
}
