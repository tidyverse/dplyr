Hi,

This is an automated email to let you know about the upcoming release of {{{ my_package }}}, which will be submitted to CRAN on {{{ date }}} (in about two weeks). This is my second attempt at getting dplyr 0.5.0 onto CRAN, and this time it's definitely going to succeed. Please get in touch if you need any help getting your package ready for this dplyr update!

To check for potential problems, I ran `R CMD check` on your package {{{your_package}}} ({{{your_version}}}). 

I found: {{{your_summary}}}.

{{#you_have_problems}}
{{{your_results}}}

If I got an ERROR because I couldn't install your package (or one of it's dependencies), my apologies. You'll have to run the checks yourself (unfortunately I don't have the time to diagnose installation failures as I have to run checks on hundreds of packages).

Otherwise, please carefully look at the results, and let me know if I've introduced a bug in {{{ my_package }}}. If I have, I'd really appreciate a minimal reproducible example that uses only {{{ my_package }}} functions. That way I can find and fix the bug as quickly as possible.

If it doesn't look like a bug in {{{ my_package }}}, please prepare an update for CRAN. Ideally you'll tweak your package so it works with both the released and development versions of dplyr. Otherwise, be prepared to submit your package to CRAN soon after I let you know that I've submitted.

To get the development version of {{{ my_package }}} so you can run the checks yourself, you can run:

    # install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("{{my_github}}")

It looks like everything is ok, so you don't need to take any action, but you might want to read the NEWS, <https://github.com/{{{my_github}}}/blob/master/NEWS.md>, to see what's changed.

If you have any questions about this email, please feel free to respond directly.
