release_details: |
  We've pushed back the package release by two weeks, just to give everyone
  a little more time. Please see the recent blog post,
  <https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/04/dplyr-1-0-0-package-dev/>,
  for details of common problems and how to get help if you need it.

  Apologies if this email is repetitive; we don't currently have any way to
  track packages that are fixed on GitHub but not on CRAN.
