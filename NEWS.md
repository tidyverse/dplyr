# dplyr 0.1.3.0.99

* `summarise_each()` and `mutate_each()` make it easy to apply one or more
  functions to multiple columns in a tbl (#178).

* Added `memory` vignette which discusses how dplyr minimises memory usage
  for local data frames (#198).

* Tweak `changes()` output to make it more clear when columns are added or
  deleted.

* `chain()` is now deprecated. Please use `%.%` instead.

* dplyr is more careful when setting the keys of data tables, so it never
  accidentally modifies an object that it doesn't own. It also avoids
  unnecessary key setting which negatively affected performance.
  (#193, #255).

* `copy_to.src_mysql()` now works on windows (#323)

* SQL translation always evaluates subsetting (`$`, `[`, `[[`) locally.
  (#318).

* `select()` now correctly renames variables in remote sql tbls (#317).

* `select()` now implicitely adds grouping variables (#170).

* Added `new-sql-backend` vignette which discusses how to add a new
  SQL backend/source to dplyr.

* `sample_n()` randomly samples a fixed number of rows from a tbl;
  `sample_frac()` randomly samples a fixed fraction of rows. Only works
  for local data frames and data tables (#202).

* `glimpse()` makes it possible to see all the columns in a tbl,
  displaying as much data for each variable as can be fit on a single line.

* `rbind_all()` is stricter and only accepts list of data frames (#288)

* `row_number()` can be called without arguments, in which case it returns
  the same as `1:n()` (#303).

* Support for [MonetDB](http://www.monetdb.org) tables with `src_monetdb()` (#8).

* `"comment"` attribute is allowed (white listed) as well as names (#346).

* `all.equal.data.frame` from base is no longer bypassed. we now have 
  `all.equal.tbl_df` and `all.equal.tbl_dt` methods (#332). 
  
* hybrid versions of `min`, `max`, `mean`, `var`, `sd` and `sum` 
  handle the `na.rm` argument (#168).   

## Bug fixes

* Code adapted to Rcpp > 0.11.1

* internal class `DataDots` did not handle the case where `...` was missing. (#338)

* `arrange()` correctly handles NA in numeric vectors (#331).

* `arrange()` handles data frames with 0 rows (#289).

* `*_join()` don't reorder column names (#324).

* internal `sum` correctly handles integer (under/over)flow (#308).

* `summarise()` checks consistency of outputs (#300).

* `rbind_*` propagates time zone information for `POSIXct` columns (#298).

* `rbind_*` is less strict about type promotion. The numeric `Collecter` allows
  collection of integer and logical vectors. The integer `Collecter` also collects
  logical values (#321).
  
* `summarise` does not retain `names` attribute (#357). 

* internal `DataDots` class protects against missing variables in verbs (#314). 

* `top_n` correctly returns `n` rows instead of `n - 1` (#367).

# dplyr 0.1.3

## Bug fixes

* `select()` actually renames columns in a data table (#284).

* `rbind_all()` and `rbind_list()` now handle missing values in factors (#279).

* SQL joins now work better if names duplicated in both x and y tables (#310).

* Builds against Rcpp 0.11.1

* `select()` correctly works with the vars attribute (#309).

* Internal code is stricter when deciding if a data frame is grouped (#308):
  this avoids a number of situations which previously causedd .

* More data frame joins work with missing values in keys (#306).

# dplyr 0.1.2

## New features

* `select()` is substantially more powerful. You can use named arguments to
  rename existing variables, and new functions `starts_with()`, `ends_with()`,
  `contains()`, `matches()` and `num_range()` to select variables based on
  their names. It now also makes a shallow copy, substantially reducing its
  memory impact (#158, #172, #192, #232).

* `summarize()` added as alias for `summarise()` for people from countries
  that don't don't spell things correctly ;) (#245)

## Bug fixes

* `filter()` now fails when given anything other than a logical vector, and
  correctly handles missing values (#249). `filter.numeric()` proxies
  `stats::filter()` so you can continue to use `filter()` function with
  numeric inputs (#264).

* `summarise()` correctly uses newly created variables (#259).

* `mutate()` correctly propagates attributes (#265) and `mutate.data.frame()`
  correctly mutates the same variable repeatedly (#243).

* `lead()` and `lag()` preserve attributes, so they now work with
  dates, times and factors (#166).

* `n()` never accepts arguments (#223).

* `row_number()` gives correct results (#227).

* `rbind_all()` silently ignores data frames with 0 rows or 0 columns (#274).

* `group_by()` orders the result (#242). It also checks that columns
  are of supported types (#233, #276).

* The hybrid evaluator did not handle some expressions correctly, for
  example in `if(n() > 5) 1 else 2` the subexpression `n()` was not
  substituted correctly. It also correctly processes `$` (#278).

* `arrange()` checks that all columns are of supported types (#266). It also
  handles list columns (#282).

* Working towards Solaris compatibility.

* Benchmarking vignette temporarily disabled due to microbenchmark
  problems reported by BDR.

# dplyr 0.1.1

## Improvements

* new `location()` and `changes()` functions which provide more information
  about how data frames are stored in memory so that you can see what
  gets copied.

* renamed `explain_tbl()` to `explain()` (#182).

* `tally()` gains `sort` argument to sort output so highest counts
  come first (#173).

* `ungroup.grouped_df()`, `tbl_df()`, `as.data.frame.tbl_df()` now only
  make shallow copies of their inputs (#191).

* The `benchmark-baseball` vignette now contains fairer (including grouping
  times) comparisons with `data.table`. (#222)

## Bug fixes

* `filter()` (#221) and `summarise()` (#194) correctly propagate attributes.

* `summarise()` throws an error when asked to summarise an unknown variable
  instead of crashing (#208).

* `group_by()` handles factors with missing values (#183).

* `filter()` handles scalar results (#217) and better handles scoping, e.g.
  `filter(., variable)` where `variable` is defined in the function that calls
  `filter`. It also handles `T` and `F` as aliases to `TRUE` and `FALSE`
  if there are no `T` or `F` variables in the data or in the scope.

* `select.grouped_df` fails when the grouping variables are not included
  in the selected variables (#170)

* `all.equal.data.frame()` handles a corner case where the data frame has
  `NULL` names (#217)

* `mutate()` gives informative error message on unsupported types (#179)

* dplyr source package no longer includes pandas benchmark, reducing
  download size from 2.8 MB to 0.5 MB.
