# dplyr 0.4.1.9000

* `lag` and `lead` for grouped data were confused about indices and therefore
  produced wrong results (#925, #937)

* `bind_rows()`, `bind_cols()` and `combine()` now accept indistinctively
  any number of data frames and list of data frames as arguments (@lionel-).

# dplyr 0.4.1

* Don't assume that RPostgreSQL is available.

# dplyr 0.4.0

## New features

* `add_rownames()` turns row names into an explicit variable (#639).

* `as_data_frame()` efficiently coerces a list into a data frame (#749).

* `bind_rows()` and `bind_cols()` efficiently bind a list of data frames by
  row or column. `combine()` applies the same coercion rules to vectors
  (it works like `c()` or `unlist()` but is consistent with the `bind_rows()`
  rules).

* `right_join()` (include all rows in `y`, and matching rows in `x`) and
  `full_join()` (include all rows in `x` and `y`) complete the family of
  mutating joins (#96).

* `group_indices()` computes a unique integer id for each group (#771). It
  can be called on a grouped_df without any arguments or on a data frame
  with same arguments as `group_by()`.

## New vignettes

* `vignette("data_frames")` describes dplyr functions that make it easier
  and faster to create and coerce data frames. It subsumes the old `memory`
  vignette.

* `vignette("two-table")` describes how two-table verbs work in dplyr.

## Minor improvements

* `data_frame()` (and `as_data_frame()` & `tbl_df()`) now explicitly
  forbid columns that are data frames or matrices (#775). All columns
  must be either a 1d atomic vector or a 1d list.

* `do()` uses lazyeval to correctly evaluate its arguments in the correct
  environment (#744), and new `do_()` is the SE equivalent of `do()` (#718).
  You can modify grouped data in place: this is probably a bad idea but it's
  sometimes convenient (#737). `do()` on grouped data tables now passes in all
  columns (not all columns except grouping vars) (#735, thanks to @kismsu).
  `do()` with database tables no longer potentially includes grouping
  variables twice (#673). Finally, `do()` gives more consistent outputs when
  there are no rows or no groups (#625).

* `first()` and `last()` preserve factors, dates and times (#509).

* Overhaul of single table verbs for data.table backend. They now all use
  a consistent (and simpler) code base. This ensures that (e.g.) `n()`
  now works in all verbs (#579).

* In `*_join()`, you can now name only those variables that are different between
  the two tables, e.g. `inner_join(x, y, c("a", "b", "c" = "d"))` (#682).
  If non-join colums are the same, dplyr will add `.x` and `.y`
  suffixes to distinguish the source (#655).

* `mutate()` handles complex vectors (#436) and forbids `POSIXlt` results
  (instead of crashing) (#670).

* `select()` now implements a more sophisticated algorithm so if you're
  doing multiples includes and excludes with and without names, you're more
  likely to get what you expect (#644). You'll also get a better error
  message if you supply an input that doesn't resolve to an integer
  column position (#643).

* Printing has recieved a number of small tweaks. All `print()` method methods
  invisibly return their input so you can interleave `print()` statements into a
  pipeline to see interim results. `print()` will column names of 0 row data
  frames (#652), and will never print more 20 rows (i.e.
  `options(dplyr.print_max)` is now 20), not 100 (#710). Row names are no
  never printed since no dplyr method is guaranteed to preserve them (#669).

    `glimpse()` prints the number of observations (#692)

    `type_sum()` gains a data frame method.

* `summarise()` handles list output columns (#832)

* `slice()` works for data tables (#717). Documentation clarifies that
  slice can't work with relational databases, and the examples show
  how to achieve the same results using `filter()` (#720).

* dplyr now requires RSQLite >= 1.0. This shouldn't affect your code
  in any way (except that RSQLite now doesn't need to be attached) but does
  simplify the internals (#622).

* Functions that need to combine multiple results into a single column
  (e.g. `join()`, `bind_rows()` and `summarise()`) are more careful about
  coercion.

    Joining factors with the same levels in the same order preserves the
    original levels (#675). Joining factors with non-identical levels
    generates a warning and coerces to character (#684). Joining a character
    to a factor (or vice versa) generates a warning and coerces to character.
    Avoid these warnings by ensuring your data is compatible before joining.

    `rbind_list()` will throw an error if you attempt to combine an integer and
    factor (#751). `rbind()`ing a column full of `NA`s is allowed and just
    collects the appropriate missing value for the column type being collected
    (#493).

    `summarise()` is more careful about `NA`, e.g. the decision on the result
    type will be delayed until the first non NA value is returned (#599).
    It will complain about loss of precision coercions, which can happen for
    expressions that return integers for some groups and a doubles for others
    (#599).

* A number of functions gained new or improved hybrid handlers: `first()`,
  `last()`, `nth()` (#626), `lead()` & `lag()` (#683), `%in%` (#126). That means
  when you use these functions in a dplyr verb, we handle them in C++, rather
  than calling back to R, and hence improving performance.

    Hybrid `min_rank()` correctly handles `NaN` values (#726). Hybrid
    implementation of `nth()` falls back to R evaluation when `n` is not
    a length one integer or numeric, e.g. when it's an expression (#734).

    Hybrid `dense_rank()`, `min_rank()`, `cume_dist()`, `ntile()`, `row_number()`
    and `percent_rank()` now preserve NAs (#774)

* `filter` returns its input when it has no rows or no columns (#782).

* Join functions keep attributes (e.g. time zone information) from the
  left argument for `POSIXct` and `Date` objects (#819), and only
  only warn once about each incompatibility (#798).

## Bug fixes

* `[.tbl_df` correctly computes row names for 0-column data frames, avoiding
  problems with xtable (#656). `[.grouped_df` will silently drop grouping
  if you don't include the grouping columns (#733).

* `data_frame()` now acts correctly if the first argument is a vector to be
  recycled. (#680 thanks @jimhester)

* `filter.data.table()` works if the table has a variable called "V1" (#615).

* `*_join()` keeps columns in original order (#684).
  Joining a factor to a character vector doesn't segfault (#688).
  `*_join` functions can now deal with multiple encodings (#769),
  and correctly name results (#855).

* `*_join.data.table()` works when data.table isn't attached (#786).

* `group_by()` on a data table preserves original order of the rows (#623).
  `group_by()` supports variables with more than 39 characters thanks to
  a fix in lazyeval (#705). It gives meaninful error message when a variable
  is not found in the data frame (#716).

* `grouped_df()` requires `vars` to be a list of symbols (#665).

* `min(.,na.rm = TRUE)` works with `Date`s built on numeric vectors (#755)

* `rename_()` generic gets missing `.dots` argument (#708).

* `row_number()`, `min_rank()`, `percent_rank()`, `dense_rank()`, `ntile()` and
  `cume_dist()` handle data frames with 0 rows (#762). They all preserve
  missing values (#774). `row_number()` doesn't segfault when giving an external
  variable with the wrong number of variables (#781)

* `group_indices` handles the edge case when there are no variables (#867)

# dplyr 0.3.0.1

* Fixed problem with test script on Windows.

# dplyr 0.3

## New functions

* `between()` vector function efficiently determines if numeric values fall
  in a range, and is translated to special form for SQL (#503).

* `count()` makes it even easier to do (weighted) counts (#358).

* `data_frame()` by @kevinushey is a nicer way of creating data frames.
  It never coerces column types (no more `stringsAsFactors = FALSE`!),
  never munges column names, and never adds row names. You can use previously
  defined columns to compute new columns (#376).

* `distinct()` returns distinct (unique) rows of a tbl (#97). Supply
  additional variables to return the first row for each unique combination
  of variables.

* Set operations, `intersect()`, `union()` and `setdiff()` now have methods
  for data frames, data tables and SQL database tables (#93). They pass their
  arguments down to the base functions, which will ensure they raise errors if
  you pass in two many arguments.

* Joins (e.g. `left_join()`, `inner_join()`, `semi_join()`, `anti_join()`)
  now allow you to join on different variables in `x` and `y` tables by
  supplying a named vector to `by`. For example, `by = c("a" = "b")` joins
  `x.a` to `y.b`.

* `n_groups()` function tells you how many groups in a tbl. It returns
  1 for ungrouped data. (#477)

* `transmute()` works like `mutate()` but drops all variables that you didn't
  explicitly refer to (#302).

* `rename()` makes it easy to rename variables - it works similarly to
  `select()` but it preserves columns that you didn't otherwise touch.

* `slice()` allows you to selecting rows by position (#226). It includes
  positive integers, drops negative integers and you can use expression like
  `n()`.

## Programming with dplyr (non-standard evaluation)

* You can now program with dplyr - every function that does non-standard
  evaluation (NSE) has a standard evaluation (SE) version ending in `_`.
  This is powered by the new lazyeval package which provides all the tools
  needed to implement NSE consistently and correctly.

* See `vignette("nse")` for full details.

* `regroup()` is deprecated. Please use the more flexible `group_by_()`
  instead.

* `summarise_each_q()` and `mutate_each_q()` are deprecated. Please use
  `summarise_each_()` and `mutate_each_()` instead.

* `funs_q` has been replaced with `funs_`.

## Removed and deprecated features

* `%.%` has been deprecated: please use `%>%` instead. `chain()` is
  defunct. (#518)

* `filter.numeric()` removed. Need to figure out how to reimplement with
  new lazy eval system.

* The `Progress` refclass is no longer exported to avoid conflicts with shiny.
  Instead use `progress_estimated()` (#535).

* `src_monetdb()` is now implemented in MonetDB.R, not dplyr.

* `show_sql()` and `explain_sql()` and matching global options `dplyr.show_sql`
  and `dplyr.explain_sql` have been removed. Instead use `show_query()` and
  `explain()`.

## Minor improvements and bug fixes

* Main verbs now have individual documentation pages (#519).

* `%>%` is simply re-exported from magrittr, instead of creating a local copy
  (#496, thanks to @jimhester)

* Examples now use `nycflights13` instead of `hflights` because it the variables
  have better names and there are a few interlinked tables (#562). `Lahman` and
  `nycflights13` are (once again) suggested packages. This means many examples
  will not work unless you explicitly install them with
  `install.packages(c("Lahman", "nycflights13"))` (#508). dplyr now depends on
  Lahman 3.0.1. A number of examples have been updated to reflect modified
  field names (#586).

* `do()` now displays the progress bar only when used in interactive prompts
  and not when knitting (#428, @jimhester).

* `glimpse()` now prints a trailing new line (#590).

* `group_by()` has more consistent behaviour when grouping by constants:
  it creates a new column with that value (#410). It renames grouping
  variables (#410). The first argument is now `.data` so you can create
  new groups with name x (#534).

* Now instead of overriding `lag()`, dplyr overrides `lag.default()`,
  which should avoid clobbering lag methods added by other packages.
  (#277).

* `mutate(data, a = NULL)` removes the variable `a` from the returned
  dataset (#462).

* `trunc_mat()` and hence `print.tbl_df()` and friends gets a `width` argument
  to control the deafult output width. Set `options(dplyr.width = Inf)` to
  always show all columns (#589).

* `select()` gains `one_of()` selector: this allows you to select variables
  provided by a character vector (#396). It fails immediately if you give an
  empty pattern to `starts_with()`,  `ends_with()`, `contains()` or `matches()`
  (#481, @leondutoit). Fixed buglet in `select()` so that you can now create
  variables called `val` (#564).

* Switched from RC to R6.

* `tally()` and `top_n()` work consistently: neither accidentally
  evaluates the the `wt` param. (#426, @mnel)

* `rename` handles grouped data (#640).

## Minor improvements and bug fixes by backend

### Databases

* The db backend system has been completely overhauled in order to make
  it possible to add backends in other packages, and to support a much
  wider range of databases. See `vignette("new-sql-backend")` for instruction
  on how to create your own (#568).

* `src_mysql()` gains a method for `explain()`.

* When `mutate()` creates a new variable that uses a window function,
  automatically wrap the result in a subquery (#484).

* Correct SQL generation for `first()` and `last()` (#531).

* `order_by()` now works in conjunction with window functions in databases
  that support them.

### Data frames/`tbl_df`

* All verbs now understand how to work with `difftime()` (#390) and
  `AsIs` (#453) objects. They all check that colnames are unique (#483), and
  are more robust when columns are not present (#348, #569, #600).

* Hybrid evaluation bugs fixed:

    * Call substitution stopped too early when a sub expression contained a
      `$` (#502).

    * Handle `::` and `:::` (#412).

    * `cumany()` and `cumall()` properly handle `NA` (#408).

    * `nth()` now correctly preserve the class when using dates, times and
      factors (#509).

    * no longer substitutes within `order_by()` because `order_by()` needs to do
      its own NSE (#169).

* `[.tbl_df` always returns a tbl_df (i.e. `drop = FALSE` is the default)
  (#587, #610). `[.grouped_df` preserves important output attributes (#398).

* `arrange()` keeps the grouping structure of grouped data (#491, #605),
  and preserves input classes (#563).

* `contains()` accidentally matched regular expressions, now it passes
  `fixed = TRUE` to `grep()` (#608).

* `filter()` asserts all variables are white listed (#566).

* `mutate()` makes a `rowwise_df` when given a `rowwise_df` (#463).

* `rbind_all()` creates `tbl_df` objects instead of raw `data.frame`s.

* If `select()` doesn't match any variables, it returns a 0-column data frame,
  instead of the original (#498). It no longer fails when if some columns
  are not named (#492)

* `sample_n()` and `sample_frac()` methods for data.frames exported.
  (#405, @alyst)

* A grouped data frame may have 0 groups (#486). Grouped df objects
  gain some basic validity checking, which should prevent some crashes
  related to corrupt `grouped_df` objects made by `rbind()` (#606).

* More coherence when joining columns of compatible but different types,
  e.g. when joining a character vector and a factor (#455),
  or a numeric and integer (#450)

* `mutate()` works for on zero-row grouped data frame, and
  with list columns (#555).

* `LazySubset` was confused about input data size (#452).

* Internal `n_distinct()` is stricter about it's inputs: it requires one symbol
  which must be from the data frame (#567).

* `rbind_*()` handle data frames with 0 rows (#597). They fill character
  vector columns with `NA` instead of blanks (#595).  They work with
  list columns (#463).

* Improved handling of encoding for column names (#636).

* Improved handling of hybrid evaluation re $ and @ (#645).

### Data tables

* Fix major omission in `tbl_dt()` and `grouped_dt()` methods - I was
  accidentally doing a deep copy on every result :(

* `summarise()` and `group_by()` now retain over-allocation when working with
  data.tables (#475, @arunsrinivasan).

* joining two data.tables now correctly dispatches to data table methods,
  and result is a data table (#470)

### Cubes

* `summarise.tbl_cube()` works with single grouping variable (#480).

# dplyr 0.2

## Piping

dplyr now imports `%>%` from magrittr (#330). I recommend that you use this instead of `%.%` because it is easier to type (since you can hold down the shift key) and is more flexible. With you `%>%`, you can control which argument on the RHS recieves the LHS by using the pronoun `.`. This makes `%>%` more useful with base R functions because they don't always take the data frame as the first argument. For example you could pipe `mtcars` to `xtabs()` with:

    mtcars %>% xtabs( ~ cyl + vs, data = .)

Thanks to @smbache for the excellent magrittr package. dplyr only provides `%>%` from magrittr, but it contains many other useful functions. To use them, load `magrittr` explicitly: `library(magrittr)`. For more details, see `vignette("magrittr")`.

`%.%` will be deprecated in a future version of dplyr, but it won't happen for a while. I've also deprecated `chain()` to encourage a single style of dplyr usage: please use `%>%` instead.

## Do

`do()` has been completely overhauled. There are now two ways to use it, either with multiple named arguments or a single unnamed arguments. `group_by()` + `do()` is equivalent to `plyr::dlply`, except it always returns a data frame.

If you use named arguments, each argument becomes a list-variable in the output. A list-variable can contain any arbitrary R object so it's particularly well suited for storing models.

    library(dplyr)
    models <- mtcars %>% group_by(cyl) %>% do(lm = lm(mpg ~ wt, data = .))
    models %>% summarise(rsq = summary(lm)$r.squared)

If you use an unnamed argument, the result should be a data frame. This allows you to apply arbitrary functions to each group.

    mtcars %>% group_by(cyl) %>% do(head(., 1))

Note the use of the `.` pronoun to refer to the data in the current group.

`do()` also has an automatic progress bar. It appears if the computation takes longer than 5 seconds and lets you know (approximately) how much longer the job will take to complete.

## New verbs

dplyr 0.2 adds three new verbs:

* `glimpse()` makes it possible to see all the columns in a tbl,
  displaying as much data for each variable as can be fit on a single line.

* `sample_n()` randomly samples a fixed number of rows from a tbl;
  `sample_frac()` randomly samples a fixed fraction of rows. Only works
  for local data frames and data tables (#202).

* `summarise_each()` and `mutate_each()` make it easy to apply one or more
  functions to multiple columns in a tbl (#178).

## Minor improvements

* If you load plyr after dplyr, you'll get a message suggesting that you
  load plyr first (#347).

* `as.tbl_cube()` gains a method for matrices (#359, @paulstaab)

* `compute()` gains `temporary` argument so you can control whether the
  results are temporary or permanent (#382, @cpsievert)

* `group_by()` now defaults to `add = FALSE` so that it sets the grouping
  variables rather than adding to the existing list. I think this is how
  most people expected `group_by` to work anyway, so it's unlikely to
  cause problems (#385).

* Support for [MonetDB](http://www.monetdb.org) tables with `src_monetdb()`
  (#8, thanks to @hannesmuehleisen).

* New vignettes:

    * `memory` vignette which discusses how dplyr minimises memory usage
      for local data frames (#198).

    *  `new-sql-backend` vignette which discusses how to add a new
       SQL backend/source to dplyr.

* `changes()` output more clearly distinguishes which columns were added or
  deleted.

* `explain()` is now generic.

* dplyr is more careful when setting the keys of data tables, so it never
  accidentally modifies an object that it doesn't own. It also avoids
  unnecessary key setting which negatively affected performance.
  (#193, #255).

* `print()` methods for `tbl_df`, `tbl_dt` and `tbl_sql` gain `n` argument to
  control the number of rows printed (#362). They also works better when you have
  columns containing lists of complex objects.

* `row_number()` can be called without arguments, in which case it returns
  the same as `1:n()` (#303).

* `"comment"` attribute is allowed (white listed) as well as names (#346).

* hybrid versions of `min`, `max`, `mean`, `var`, `sd` and `sum`
  handle the `na.rm` argument (#168). This should yield substantial
  performance improvements for those functions.

* Special case for call to `arrange()` on a grouped data frame with no arguments. (#369)

## Bug fixes

* Code adapted to Rcpp > 0.11.1

* internal `DataDots` class protects against missing variables in verbs (#314),
  including the case where `...` is missing. (#338)

* `all.equal.data.frame` from base is no longer bypassed. we now have
  `all.equal.tbl_df` and `all.equal.tbl_dt` methods (#332).

* `arrange()` correctly handles NA in numeric vectors (#331) and 0 row
  data frames (#289).

* `copy_to.src_mysql()` now works on windows (#323)

* `*_join()` doesn't reorder column names (#324).

* `rbind_all()` is stricter and only accepts list of data frames (#288)

* `rbind_*` propagates time zone information for `POSIXct` columns (#298).

* `rbind_*` is less strict about type promotion. The numeric `Collecter` allows
  collection of integer and logical vectors. The integer `Collecter` also collects
  logical values (#321).

* internal `sum` correctly handles integer (under/over)flow (#308).

* `summarise()` checks consistency of outputs (#300) and drops `names`
  attribute of output columns (#357).

* join functions throw error instead of crashing when there are no common
  variables between the data frames, and also give a better error message when
  only one data frame has a by variable (#371).

* `top_n()` returns `n` rows instead of `n - 1` (@leondutoit, #367).

* SQL translation always evaluates subsetting operators (`$`, `[`, `[[`)
  locally. (#318).

* `select()` now renames variables in remote sql tbls (#317) and
  implicitly adds grouping variables (#170).

* internal `grouped_df_impl` function errors if there are no variables to group by (#398).

* `n_distinct` did not treat NA correctly in the numeric case #384.

* Some compiler warnings triggered by -Wall or -pedantic have been eliminated.

* `group_by` only creates one group for NA (#401).

* Hybrid evaluator did not evaluate expression in correct environment (#403).

# dplyr 0.1.3

## Bug fixes

* `select()` actually renames columns in a data table (#284).

* `rbind_all()` and `rbind_list()` now handle missing values in factors (#279).

* SQL joins now work better if names duplicated in both x and y tables (#310).

* Builds against Rcpp 0.11.1

* `select()` correctly works with the vars attribute (#309).

* Internal code is stricter when deciding if a data frame is grouped (#308):
  this avoids a number of situations which previously causedd .

* More data frame joins work with missing values in keys (#306).

# dplyr 0.1.2

## New features

* `select()` is substantially more powerful. You can use named arguments to
  rename existing variables, and new functions `starts_with()`, `ends_with()`,
  `contains()`, `matches()` and `num_range()` to select variables based on
  their names. It now also makes a shallow copy, substantially reducing its
  memory impact (#158, #172, #192, #232).

* `summarize()` added as alias for `summarise()` for people from countries
  that don't don't spell things correctly ;) (#245)

## Bug fixes

* `filter()` now fails when given anything other than a logical vector, and
  correctly handles missing values (#249). `filter.numeric()` proxies
  `stats::filter()` so you can continue to use `filter()` function with
  numeric inputs (#264).

* `summarise()` correctly uses newly created variables (#259).

* `mutate()` correctly propagates attributes (#265) and `mutate.data.frame()`
  correctly mutates the same variable repeatedly (#243).

* `lead()` and `lag()` preserve attributes, so they now work with
  dates, times and factors (#166).

* `n()` never accepts arguments (#223).

* `row_number()` gives correct results (#227).

* `rbind_all()` silently ignores data frames with 0 rows or 0 columns (#274).

* `group_by()` orders the result (#242). It also checks that columns
  are of supported types (#233, #276).

* The hybrid evaluator did not handle some expressions correctly, for
  example in `if(n() > 5) 1 else 2` the subexpression `n()` was not
  substituted correctly. It also correctly processes `$` (#278).

* `arrange()` checks that all columns are of supported types (#266). It also
  handles list columns (#282).

* Working towards Solaris compatibility.

* Benchmarking vignette temporarily disabled due to microbenchmark
  problems reported by BDR.

# dplyr 0.1.1

## Improvements

* new `location()` and `changes()` functions which provide more information
  about how data frames are stored in memory so that you can see what
  gets copied.

* renamed `explain_tbl()` to `explain()` (#182).

* `tally()` gains `sort` argument to sort output so highest counts
  come first (#173).

* `ungroup.grouped_df()`, `tbl_df()`, `as.data.frame.tbl_df()` now only
  make shallow copies of their inputs (#191).

* The `benchmark-baseball` vignette now contains fairer (including grouping
  times) comparisons with `data.table`. (#222)

## Bug fixes

* `filter()` (#221) and `summarise()` (#194) correctly propagate attributes.

* `summarise()` throws an error when asked to summarise an unknown variable
  instead of crashing (#208).

* `group_by()` handles factors with missing values (#183).

* `filter()` handles scalar results (#217) and better handles scoping, e.g.
  `filter(., variable)` where `variable` is defined in the function that calls
  `filter`. It also handles `T` and `F` as aliases to `TRUE` and `FALSE`
  if there are no `T` or `F` variables in the data or in the scope.

* `select.grouped_df` fails when the grouping variables are not included
  in the selected variables (#170)

* `all.equal.data.frame()` handles a corner case where the data frame has
  `NULL` names (#217)

* `mutate()` gives informative error message on unsupported types (#179)

* dplyr source package no longer includes pandas benchmark, reducing
  download size from 2.8 MB to 0.5 MB.
