## Overview

dplyr is a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges:

* `mutate()` adds new variables that are functions of existing variables
* `select()` picks variables based on their names.
* `filter()` picks cases based on their values.
* `summarise()` reduces multiple values down to a single summary.
* `arrange()` changes the ordering of the rows.

These all combine naturally with `group_by()` which allows you to perform any operation "by group". You can learn more about them in `vignette("dplyr")`. As well as these single-table verbs, dplyr also provides a variety of two-table verbs, which you can learn about in `vignette("two-table")`.

If you are new to dplyr, the best place to start is the [data import chapter](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html) in R for data science.

## Backends

dplyr is designed to abstract over how the data is stored. Out of the box, dplyr works with data frames/tibbles; other packages provide alternative computational backends:

* For large, in-memory datasets, try [dtplyr](http://dtplyr.tidyverse.org/)
  to access the excellent performance of [data.table](http://r-datatable.com/).
  
* For data in relational databases, [dbplyr](http://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/) 
  will automatically translate your dplyr code in to SQL.
  
* For very large datasets stored in [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org), 
  use [sparklyr](https://spark.rstudio.com).

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# The easiest way to get dplyr is to install the whole tidyverse:
install.packages("tidyverse")

# Alternatively, install just dplyr:
install.packages("dplyr")
```

### Development version

To get a bug fix, or use a feature from the development version, you can install 
dplyr from GitHub.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/dplyr")
```

## Usage

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)

starwars %>% 
  filter(species == "Droid")

starwars %>% 
  select(name, ends_with("color"))

starwars %>% 
  mutate(name, bmi = mass / ((height / 100)  ^ 2)) %>%
  select(name:mass, bmi)

starwars %>% 
  arrange(desc(mass))

starwars %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mass = mean(mass, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  filter(n > 1,
         mass > 50)
```

## Getting help
