- title: Experimental
  desc: >
    Experimental functions are a testing ground for new approaches that we
    believe to be worthy of greater exposure. There is no guarantee that these
    functions will stay around in the future, so please reach out if you find
    them useful.

- title: Questioning
  desc: >
    We have our doubts about questioning functions. We're not certain that
    they're inadequate, or we don't have a good replacement in mind, but
    these functions are at risk of removal in the future.
  contents:
  - all_equal

- title: Superseded
  desc: >
    Superseded functions have been replaced by new approaches that we believe
    to be superior, but we don't want to force you to change until you're
    ready, so the existing functions will stay around for several years.
