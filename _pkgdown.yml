- subtitle: Multiple columns
  desc: >
    Pair these functions with `mutate()`, `summarise()`, `filter()`, and
    `group_by()` to operate on multiple columns simultaneously.
  contents:
  - across
  - c_across

- title: Vector functions
  desc: >
    Unlike other dplyr functions, these functions work on individual vectors,
    not data frames.

  - lead
  - n_distinct

- title: Grouping helpers
  desc: >
    This (mostly) experimental family of functions are used to manipulate
    groups in various ways.
  contents:
  - group_cols
  - group_map
  - group_modify
  - group_trim
  - group_split
  - with_groups

- title: Questioning
  desc: >
    We have our doubts about questioning functions. We're not certain that
    they're inadequate, or we don't have a good replacement in mind, but
    these functions are at risk of removal in the future.
  contents:
  - all_equal

- title: Superseded
  desc: >
    Superseded functions have been replaced by new approaches that we believe
    to be superior, but we don't want to force you to change until you're
    ready, so the existing functions will stay around for several years.
