Finally, () gives consistent outputs rows groups (#625). first() last() preserve factors, dates times (#509). Overhaul single table verbs data.table backend. now use consistent (simpler) code base. ensures (e.g.) n() now works verbs (#579). *_join(), can now name variables different two tables, e.g. inner_join(x, y, c(\"\", \"b\", \"c\" = \"d\")) (#682). non-join columns , dplyr add .x .y suffixes distinguish source (#655). mutate() handles complex vectors (#436) forbids POSIXlt results (instead crashing) (#670). select() now implements sophisticated algorithm ’re multiples includes excludes without names, ’re likely get expect (#644). ’ll also get better error message supply input doesn’t resolve integer column position (#643).

Hybrid min_rank() correctly handles NaN values (#726). Hybrid implementation nth() falls back R evaluation n length one integer numeric, e.g. ’s expression (#734). Hybrid dense_rank(), min_rank(), cume_dist(), ntile(), row_number() percent_rank() now preserve NAs (#774) filter returns input rows columns (#782).
