#' Mutating joins
#'
#' @description
#' Mutating joins add columns from `y` to `x`, matching observations based on
#' the keys. There are four mutating joins: the inner join, and the three outer
#' joins.
#'
#' ## Inner join
#'
#' An `inner_join()` only keeps observations from `x` that have a matching key
#' in `y`.
#'
#' The most important property of an inner join is that unmatched rows in either
#' input are not included in the result. This means that generally inner joins
#' are not appropriate in most analyses, because it is too easy to lose
#' observations.
#'
#' ## Outer joins
#'
#' The three outer joins keep observations that appear in at least one of the
#' data frames:
#'
#' * A `left_join()` keeps all observations in `x`.
#'
#' * A `right_join()` keeps all observations in `y`.
#'
#' * A `full_join()` keeps all observations in `x` and `y`.
#'
#' ## Multiple matches
#'
#' By default, if an observation in `x` matches multiple observations in `y`,
#' all of the matching observations in `y` will be returned. If this occurs in
#' an equality join or a rolling join, a warning will be thrown stating that
#' multiple matches have been detected since this is usually surprising. If
#' multiple matches are expected in these cases, silence this warning by
#' explicitly setting `multiple = "all"`.
#'
#' @return
#' An object of the same type as `x` (including the same groups). The order of
#' the rows and columns of `x` is preserved as much as possible. The output has
#' the following properties:
#'
#' * The rows are affect by the join type.
#'    * `inner_join()` returns matched `x` rows.
#'    * `left_join()` returns all `x` rows.
#'    * `right_join()`  returns matched of `x` rows, followed by unmatched `y` rows.
#'    * `full_join()`  returns all `x` rows, followed by unmatched `y` rows.
#' * Output columns include all columns from `x` and all non-key columns from
#'   `y`. If `keep = TRUE`, the key columns from `y` are included as well.
#' * If non-key columns in `x` and `y` have the same name, `suffix`es are added
#'   to disambiguate. If `keep = TRUE` and key columns in `x` and `y` have
#'   the same name, `suffix`es are added to disambiguate these as well.
#' * If `keep = FALSE`, output columns included in `by` are coerced to their
#'   common type between `x` and `y`.
#' @section Methods:
#' These functions are **generic**s, which means that packages can provide
#' implementations (methods) for other classes. See the documentation of
#' individual methods for extra arguments and differences in behaviour.
#'
#' Methods available in currently loaded packages:
#'
#' * `inner_join()`: \Sexpr[stage=render,results=rd]{dplyr:::methods_rd("inner_join")}.
#' * `left_join()`: \Sexpr[stage=render,results=rd]{dplyr:::methods_rd("left_join")}.
#' * `right_join()`: \Sexpr[stage=render,results=rd]{dplyr:::methods_rd("right_join")}.
#' * `full_join()`: \Sexpr[stage=render,results=rd]{dplyr:::methods_rd("full_join")}.
#' @param x,y A pair of data frames, data frame extensions (e.g. a tibble), or
#'   lazy data frames (e.g. from dbplyr or dtplyr). See *Methods*, below, for
#'   more details.
#' @param by A join specification created with [join_by()], or a character
#'   vector of variables to join by.
#'
#'   If `NULL`, the default, `*_join()` will perform a natural join, using all
#'   variables in common across `x` and `y`. A message lists the variables so
#'   that you can check they're correct; suppress the message by supplying `by`
#'   explicitly.
#'
#'   To join on different variables between `x` and `y`, use a [join_by()]
#'   specification. For example, `join_by(a == b)` will match `x$a` to `y$b`.
#'
#'   To join by multiple variables, use a [join_by()] specification with
#'   multiple expressions. For example, `join_by(a == b, c == d)` will match
#'   `x$a` to `y$b` and `x$c` to `y$d`. If the column names are the same between
#'   `x` and `y`, you can shorten this by listing only the variable names, like
#'   `join_by(a, c)`.
#'
#'   [join_by()] can also be used to perform inequality, rolling, and overlap
#'   joins. See the documentation at [?join_by][join_by()] for details on
#'   these types of joins.
#'
#'   For simple equality joins, you can alternatively specify a character vector
#'   of variable names to join by. For example, `by = c("a", "b")` joins `x$a`
#'   to `y$a` and `x$b` to `y$b`. If variable names differ between `x` and `y`,
#'   use a named character vector like `by = c("x_a" = "y_a", "x_b" = "y_b")`.
#'
#'   To perform a cross-join, generating all combinations of `x` and `y`, see
#'   [cross_join()].
#' @param copy If `x` and `y` are not from the same data source,
#'   and `copy` is `TRUE`, then `y` will be copied into the
#'   same src as `x`.  This allows you to join tables across srcs, but
#'   it is a potentially expensive operation so you must opt into it.
#' @param suffix If there are non-joined duplicate variables in `x` and
#'   `y`, these suffixes will be added to the output to disambiguate them.
#'   Should be a character vector of length 2.
#' @param keep Should the join keys from both `x` and `y` be preserved in the
#'   output?
#'   - If `NULL`, the default, joins on equality retain only the keys from `x`,
#'     while joins on inequality retain the keys from both inputs.
#'   - If `TRUE`, all keys from both inputs are retained.
#'   - If `FALSE`, only keys from `x` are retained. For right and full joins,
#'     the data in key columns corresponding to rows that only exist in `y` are
#'     merged into the key columns from `x`. Can't be used when joining on
#'     inequality conditions.
#' @param ... Other parameters passed onto methods.
#' @param na_matches Should two `NA` or two `NaN` values match?
#'   - `"na"`, the default, treats two `NA` or two `NaN` values as equal, like
#'   `%in%`, [match()], and [merge()].
#'   - `"never"` treats two `NA` or two `NaN` values as different, and will
#'   never match them together or to any other values. This is similar to joins
#'   for database sources and to `base::merge(incomparables = NA)`.
#' @param multiple Handling of rows in `x` with multiple matches in `y`.
#'   For each row of `x`:
#'   - `"all"` returns every match detected in `y`. This is the same behavior
#'     as SQL.
#'   - `"any"` returns one match detected in `y`, with no guarantees on which
#'     match will be returned. It is often faster than `"first"` and `"last"`
#'     if you just need to detect if there is at least one match.
#'   - `"first"` returns the first match detected in `y`.
#'   - `"last"` returns the last match detected in `y`.
#'   - `"warning"` throws a warning if multiple matches are detected, and
#'     then falls back to `"all"`.
#'   - `"error"` throws an error if multiple matches are detected.
#'
#'   The default value of `NULL` is equivalent to `"warning"` for equality joins
#'   and rolling joins, where multiple matches are usually surprising. If any
#'   inequality join conditions are present, then it is equivalent to `"all"`,
#'   since multiple matches are usually expected.
#' @param unmatched How should unmatched keys that would result in dropped rows
#'   be handled?
#'   - `"drop"` drops unmatched keys from the result.
#'   - `"error"` throws an error if unmatched keys are detected.
#'
#'   `unmatched` is intended to protect you from accidentally dropping rows
#'   during a join. It only checks for unmatched keys in the input that could
#'   potentially drop rows.
#'   - For left joins, it checks `y`.
#'   - For right joins, it checks `x`.
#'   - For inner joins, it checks both `x` and `y`. In this case, `unmatched` is
#'     also allowed to be a character vector of length 2 to specify the behavior
#'     for `x` and `y` independently.

#' Nest join
#'
#' A nest join leaves `x` almost unchanged, except that it adds a new
#' list-column, where each element contains the rows from `y` that match the
#' corresponding row in `x`.
#'
#' # Relationship to other joins
#'
#' You can recreate many other joins from the result of a nest join:
#'
#' * [inner_join()] is a `nest_join()` plus [tidyr::unnest()].
#' * [left_join()] is a `nest_join()` plus `tidyr::unnest(keep_empty = TRUE)`.
#' * [semi_join()] is a `nest_join()` plus a `filter()` where you check
#'   that every element of data has at least one row.
#' * [anti_join()] is a `nest_join()` plus a `filter()` where you check that every
#'   element has zero rows.
#'
#' @param name The name of the list-column created by the join. If `NULL`,
#'   the default, the name of `y` is used.
#' @param keep Should the new list-column contain join keys? The default
#'   will preserve the join keys for inequality joins.
#' @return
#' The output:
#' * Is same type as `x` (including having the same groups).
#' * Has exactly the same number of rows as `x`.
#' * Contains all the columns of `x` in the same order with the same values.
#'   They are only modified (slightly) if `keep = FALSE`, when columns listed
#'   in `by` will be coerced to their common type across `x` and `y`.
#' * Gains one new column called `{name}` on the far right, a list column
#'   containing data frames the same type as `y`.
