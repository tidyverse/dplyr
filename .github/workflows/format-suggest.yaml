# Workflow derived from https://github.com/posit-dev/setup-air/tree/main/examples

on:
  # Using `pull_request_target` over `pull_request` for elevated `GITHUB_TOKEN`
  # privileges, otherwise we can't set `pull-requests: write` when the pull
  # request comes from a fork, which is our main use case (external contributors).
  #
  # `pull_request_target` runs in the context of the target branch (`main`, usually),
  # rather than in the context of the pull request like `pull_request` does. Due
  # to this, we must explicitly checkout `ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}`.
  # This is typically frowned upon by GitHub, as it exposes you to potentially running
  # untrusted code in a context where you have elevated privileges, but they explicitly
  # call out the use case of reformatting and committing back / commenting on the PR
  # as a situation that should be safe (because we aren't actually running the untrusted
  # code, we are just treating it as passive data).
