> df <- tibble(x = 1, y = 2)
> df %>% group_by(unknown)
Error: Must `group_by()` variables found in `.data`
* Column `unknown` is not found

> df %>% ungroup(x)
Error: `...` is not empty.

We detected these problematic arguments:
* `..1`

These dots only exist to allow future extensions and should be empty.

> df %>% group_by(x, y) %>% ungroup(z)
Error: Must select existing columns.
x Can't subset element with unknown name `z`.
