Warning: `funs()` is deprecated as of dplyr 0.8.0.
Please use a list of either functions or lambdas: 

  # Simple named list: 
  list(mean = mean, median = median)

  # Auto named with `tibble::lst()`:

  # Using lambdas
  list(~ mean(., trim = .2), ~ median(., na.rm = TRUE))

Error: `function(si) {
