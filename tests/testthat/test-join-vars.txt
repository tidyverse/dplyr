Message: Joining, by = c("x", "y")


by errors
=========

> join_vars2(xy, c("a", "b"))
Error: `by` must be supplied when `x` and `y` have no common variables
i use by = character()` to perform a cross-join

> join_vars2(xy, xy, by = FALSE)
Error: `by` must be a (named) character vector, list, or NULL, not a logical vector

> join_vars2(xy, xy, by = list(1, 2))
Error: join columns must be character vectors

> join_vars2(xy, xy, by = c("x", "x"))
Error: Join columns must be unique
x Problem at position 2

> join_vars2(xy, xy, by = c("x", NA))
Error: Join columns must be not NA
x Problem at position 2

> join_vars2(xy, xy, by = c("aaa", "bbb"))
Error: Join columns must be present in data
x Problem with `aaa` and `bbb`


suffixes
========

> join_vars2(xy, xy, by = "x", suffix = "x")
Error: `suffix` must be a character vector of length 2
i suffix is a character vector of length 1

> join_vars2(xy, xy, by = "x", suffix = c("", NA))
Error: `suffix` can't be NA

> join_vars2(xy, xy, by = "x", suffix = c("", ""))
Error: `suffix` can't be the empty string for both suffixes
